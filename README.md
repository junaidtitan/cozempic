# Cozempic

Context cleaning for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) — **remove the bloat, keep everything that matters, protect Agent Teams from context loss**.

### What gets removed

Claude Code context fills up with dead weight that wastes your token budget: hundreds of progress tick messages, repeated thinking blocks and signatures, stale file reads that were superseded by edits, duplicate document injections, oversized tool outputs, and metadata bloat (token counts, stop reasons, cost fields). A typical session carries 8-46MB — most of it noise. Cozempic identifies and removes all of it using 13 composable strategies, while your actual conversation, decisions, tool results, and working context stay untouched.

### Agent Teams context loss protection

When context gets too large, Claude's auto-compaction summarizes away critical state. For **Agent Teams**, this is catastrophic: the lead agent's context is compacted, team coordination messages (TeamCreate, SendMessage, TaskCreate/Update) are discarded, the lead forgets its teammates exist, and subagents are orphaned with no recovery path. ([#23620](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/23620), [#23821](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/23821), [#24052](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/24052), [#21925](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/21925))

Cozempic prevents this with five layers of protection:

1. **Continuous checkpoint** — saves team state to disk every N seconds so it's always recoverable
2. **Hook-driven checkpoint** — fires after every Task spawn, TaskCreate/Update, before compaction, and at session end
3. **Tiered pruning** — soft threshold gently trims bloat without disruption; hard threshold does full prune + optional reload
4. **Reactive overflow recovery** — kqueue/polling file watcher detects inbox-flood overflow within milliseconds, auto-prunes with escalating prescriptions, and resumes the session (~10s downtime vs permanently dead). Circuit breaker prevents infinite recovery loops. ([#23876](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/23876))
5. **Config.json ground truth** — reads `~/.claude/teams/*/config.json` for authoritative team state (lead, members, models, cwds)

**Zero external dependencies.** Python 3.10+ stdlib only.

## Install

```bash
pip install cozempic
```

Or run directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ruya-AI/cozempic.git
cd cozempic
pip install -e .
```

## Setup

After installing, run `init` from your project directory:

```bash
cd your-project/
cozempic init
```

That's it. This auto-wires everything:

1. **Guard daemon auto-start** — `SessionStart` hook spawns `cozempic guard --daemon` when Claude Code opens. Background process, PID file prevents double-starts, logs to `/tmp/cozempic_guard_*.log`
2. **Checkpoint hooks** — `PostToolUse[Task|TaskCreate|TaskUpdate]`, `PreCompact`, `Stop` capture team state at every critical moment
3. **`/cozempic` slash command** — installed to `~/.claude/commands/` for in-session diagnosis and treatment

Idempotent — safe to run multiple times. Existing hooks and settings are preserved. No second terminal needed.

## Quick Start

```bash
# One-time setup: wire hooks + slash command
cozempic init

# List all sessions with sizes
cozempic list

# Auto-detect and diagnose the current session
cozempic current --diagnose

# Dry-run the standard prescription on current session
cozempic treat current

# Apply with backup
cozempic treat current --execute

# Go aggressive on a specific session
cozempic treat <session_id> -rx aggressive --execute

# Save team/agent state right now (no pruning, instant)
cozempic checkpoint --show

# Guard auto-starts on session open (after cozempic init)
# Or run manually with custom thresholds:
cozempic guard --threshold 50 -rx standard

# Run as background daemon (what the SessionStart hook uses):
cozempic guard --daemon

# Treat + auto-resume in a new terminal
cozempic reload -rx gentle
```

Session IDs accept full UUIDs, UUID prefixes, file paths, or `current` for auto-detection based on your working directory.

## How It Works

Each type of bloat has a dedicated **strategy** that knows exactly what to remove and what to keep. Strategies are grouped into **prescriptions** — presets that balance cleaning depth against risk:

| Prescription | Strategies | Risk | Typical Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gentle` | 3 | Minimal | 5-8% |
| `standard` | 7 | Low | 15-20% |
| `aggressive` | 13 | Moderate | 20-25% |

**Dry-run is the default.** Nothing is modified until you pass `--execute`. Backups are always created automatically.

## Strategies

| # | Strategy | What It Does | Expected |
|---|----------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | `progress-collapse` | Collapse consecutive progress tick messages | 40-48% |
| 2 | `file-history-dedup` | Deduplicate file-history-snapshot messages | 3-6% |
| 3 | `metadata-strip` | Strip token usage stats, stop_reason, costs | 1-3% |
| 4 | `thinking-blocks` | Remove/truncate thinking content + signatures | 2-5% |
| 5 | `tool-output-trim` | Trim large tool results (>8KB or >100 lines) | 1-8% |
| 6 | `stale-reads` | Remove file reads superseded by later edits | 0.5-2% |
| 7 | `system-reminder-dedup` | Deduplicate repeated system-reminder tags | 0.1-3% |
| 8 | `http-spam` | Collapse consecutive HTTP request runs | 0-2% |
| 9 | `error-retry-collapse` | Collapse repeated error-retry sequences | 0-5% |
| 10 | `background-poll-collapse` | Collapse repeated polling messages | 0-1% |
| 11 | `document-dedup` | Deduplicate large document blocks | 0-44% |
| 12 | `mega-block-trim` | Trim any content block over 32KB | safety net |
| 13 | `envelope-strip` | Strip constant envelope fields | 2-4% |

Run a single strategy:

```bash
cozempic strategy progress-collapse <session_id> -v
cozempic strategy thinking-blocks <session_id> --thinking-mode truncate
```

Use `current` as the session argument in any command to auto-detect the active session for your working directory.

## Checkpoint — Instant Team State Snapshot

Save your current team/agent state to disk without pruning or modifying anything:

```bash
# Save team state
cozempic checkpoint

# Save and print the state
cozempic checkpoint --show
```

Output:

```
  Checkpoint: 6 subagents, 9 tasks -> team-checkpoint.md

Active agent team: agents

Subagents (6):
  - af9763f [Explore] — Explore memory system [completed]
    Result: Complete understanding of the memory system...
  - aa79e90 [Explore] — Explore platform adapters [completed]
    Result: Comprehensive technical summary of platform...
  ...

Shared task list:
  - [COMPLETED] Fix team detection
  - [IN_PROGRESS] Add continuous checkpoint
  - [PENDING] Update README
```

### What gets detected

Cozempic scans two data sources and merges them:

**JSONL session file** (runtime state):

| Pattern | Source | What's Extracted |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| `Task` tool calls | Subagent spawns | agent_id, subagent_type, description, prompt |
| `<task-notification>` | Agent completion messages | status, summary, full result text |
| `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` | Shared todo list | task_id, subject, status, owner |
| `TaskOutput` / `TaskStop` | Background agent management | agent status updates |
| `TeamCreate` / `SendMessage` | Explicit team coordination | team name, teammate roles |

**`~/.claude/teams/*/config.json`** (ground truth):

| Field | What's Extracted |
|-------|-----------------|
| `name` | Authoritative team name |
| `leadAgentId` | Lead agent identifier |
| `leadSessionId` | Lead agent's session UUID |
| `members[].model` | Model used by each teammate (e.g., `claude-opus-4-6`) |
| `members[].cwd` | Working directory for each teammate |
| `members[].agentType` | Role/type of each teammate |

Config.json fields are authoritative — they override JSONL-inferred values. JSONL is authoritative for runtime state (subagent progress, task status, results).

The checkpoint is written to `.claude/projects/<project>/team-checkpoint.md`.

## Guard — Continuous Protection

Guard is a background daemon with two complementary systems:

**Proactive polling loop** (every N seconds):

- **Phase 1: Continuous checkpoint** — extracts team state and writes to disk. Lightweight read-only scan. Team state is always recoverable even if Claude crashes. Also merges `~/.claude/teams/*/config.json` as ground truth for team name, lead agent, member models, and working directories.
- **Phase 2: Soft prune** (at soft threshold) — when file size crosses the soft threshold, applies a `gentle` prescription to trim easy bloat. **No reload** — the session continues uninterrupted.
- **Phase 3: Hard prune** (at hard threshold) — applies the full prescription with team-protect, injects recovery messages, and optionally kills + resumes Claude.

**Reactive overflow recovery** (sub-second, enabled by default):

When agent team sessions go idle, Claude's InboxPoller can deliver all queued teammate messages at once, spiking the JSONL past the 200k token limit in seconds — faster than the polling loop can react. The reactive watcher uses kqueue (macOS, 0.04ms latency) or stat polling (Linux, 200ms) to detect this overflow within milliseconds. On detection:

1. **Circuit breaker check** — prevents infinite prune → resume → crash loops (max 3 recoveries in 5 minutes)
2. **Escalating prescription** — recovery #1 uses `gentle`, #2 uses `standard`, #3 uses `aggressive`
3. **Pre-flight check** — if post-prune estimate is still too large, skips resume
4. **Team-protected prune** → kill → auto-resume (~10s downtime vs permanently dead session)
5. **Breaker trip** — after 3 rapid recoveries, halts with a clear message and saves a final checkpoint

Disable with `--no-reactive` if needed. Zero impact on normal sessions — the watcher runs silently and fast-path exits for small files.

The soft threshold defaults to 60% of the hard threshold. This gives a two-phase degradation: trim early and often, escalate only when needed.

```bash
# Standard — run in a separate terminal
cozempic guard

# Custom thresholds and interval
cozempic guard --threshold 40 --soft-threshold 25 --interval 15 -rx standard

# Without auto-reload (just clean, no restart)
cozempic guard --threshold 50 --no-reload

# Disable reactive overflow recovery (polling only)
cozempic guard --no-reactive

# Aggressive at hard threshold, gentle at soft (automatic)
cozempic guard --threshold 30 -rx aggressive
```

Output:

```
  COZEMPIC GUARD v3

  Size:        5.4MB
  Soft:        30.0MB (gentle prune, no reload)

  [14:25:31] Checkpoint #2: 8 agents, 12 tasks, 156 msgs (6.1MB)
  [14:28:01] Checkpoint #3: 8 agents, 12 tasks, 189 msgs (7.2MB)
  [14:45:01] SOFT THRESHOLD: 30.2MB >= 30.0MB
             Gentle prune, no reload (cycle #1)
             Trimmed: 4.1MB saved
  [15:10:01] HARD THRESHOLD: 50.3MB >= 50.0MB
             Emergency prune with standard (cycle #1)
             Pruned: 12.4MB saved
             Team 'dev-agents' state preserved (87 messages)
```

On Ctrl+C, guard writes a final checkpoint before exiting.

### How team-protect works

During prune (soft or hard):

1. **Extract** full team state from JSONL + `~/.claude/teams/*/config.json`
2. **Separate** team messages from non-team messages
3. **Prune** only non-team messages using the prescription
4. **Merge** team messages back at their original positions
5. **Inject** a synthetic message pair confirming team state (Claude *sees* this as conversation history)
6. **Save** with backup, then optionally reload (hard only)

## Hook Integration

For the strongest protection, wire `cozempic checkpoint` into Claude Code hooks. This captures team state at every critical moment — not just on a timer.

Add to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Task",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "cozempic checkpoint 2>/dev/null || true"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "TaskCreate|TaskUpdate",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "cozempic checkpoint 2>/dev/null || true"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreCompact": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "cozempic checkpoint 2>/dev/null || true"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "cozempic checkpoint 2>/dev/null || true"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This checkpoints team state:

| Hook | When | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| `PostToolUse[Task]` | After every subagent spawn | Capture new agent immediately |
| `PostToolUse[TaskCreate\|TaskUpdate]` | After todo list changes | Track task progress |
| `PreCompact` | Right before auto-compaction | Last chance to save state |
| `Stop` | Session end | Final checkpoint |

### Protection layers summary

| Layer | Trigger | What it does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Hooks** | Every Task/TaskCreate/TaskUpdate, PreCompact, Stop | Instant checkpoint to disk |
| **Guard (checkpoint)** | Every N seconds | Extract team state + config.json, write checkpoint |
| **Guard (soft prune)** | At soft threshold (default 60% of hard) | Gentle prune, no reload, no disruption |
| **Guard (hard prune)** | At hard threshold | Full prune + team-protect + optional reload |
| **Guard (reactive)** | Sub-second file watcher (kqueue/polling) | Detect inbox-flood overflow → escalating prune → kill → resume |
| **Reload** | Manual (`cozempic reload`) | One-shot prune + auto-resume |
| **Checkpoint** | Manual (`cozempic checkpoint`) | One-shot state save |

## Reload — Treat + Auto-Resume

Prune the current session and automatically resume Claude in a new terminal:

```bash
cozempic reload -rx gentle
```

This:
1. Treats the current session with the chosen prescription
2. Generates a compact recap of the conversation
3. Spawns a watcher that waits for Claude to exit
4. When you type `/exit`, a new terminal opens with `claude --resume`
5. The recap is displayed before the resume prompt

## Doctor

Beyond context cleaning, Cozempic can check for known Claude Code configuration issues:

```bash
cozempic doctor        # Diagnose issues
cozempic doctor --fix  # Auto-fix where possible
```

Current checks:

| Check | What It Detects |
|-------|----------------|
| `trust-dialog-hang` | `hasTrustDialogAccepted=true` in `~/.claude.json` causing resume hangs on Windows |
| `oversized-sessions` | Session files >50MB likely to hang on resume |
| `stale-backups` | Old `.bak` files from previous treatments wasting disk |
| `disk-usage` | Total session storage exceeding healthy thresholds |

The `--fix` flag auto-applies fixes where safe (e.g., resetting the trust dialog flag, cleaning stale backups). Backups are created before any config modification.

## Claude Code Integration

### Slash Command

Cozempic ships with a `/cozempic` slash command that's automatically installed to `~/.claude/commands/` when you run `cozempic init`. It works in any Claude Code project.

Type `/cozempic` in any session to get an interactive menu:

1. **Diagnose** — Analyze bloat sources and recommend a prescription (read-only, no changes)
2. **Treat & Reload** (Recommended) — Diagnose, prune session, and auto-open a new terminal with clean context
3. **Treat Only** — Diagnose and prune session in-place (you resume manually with `claude --resume`)
4. **Guard Mode** — Start a background sentinel that auto-prunes before compaction kills agent teams

You can also skip the menu with arguments: `/cozempic diagnose`, `/cozempic treat`, `/cozempic guard`, or `/cozempic doctor`.

The slash command is kept up-to-date — running `cozempic init` again after upgrading will update it if a newer version is available.

### SessionStart Hook (Optional)

To persist the session ID as an environment variable for use in scripts and other hooks:

```bash
cp .claude/hooks/persist-session-id.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/persist-session-id.sh
```

Add to your `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "~/.claude/hooks/persist-session-id.sh"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

This makes `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` available in all Bash commands during the session.

## Safety

- **Always dry-run by default** — `--execute` flag required to modify files
- **Timestamped backups** — automatic `.bak` files before any modification
- **Never touches uuid/parentUuid** — conversation DAG stays intact
- **Never removes summary/queue-operation messages** — structurally important
- **Team messages are protected** — guard and checkpoint never prune Task, TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, TeamCreate, or SendMessage tool calls
- **task-notification results preserved** — agent completion results (the actual output) are captured and checkpointed
- **Strategies compose sequentially** — each runs on the output of the previous, so savings are accurate and don't overlap
