# Cozempic

Context cleaning for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) — **remove the bloat, keep everything that matters**.

Claude Code sessions grow large — 8-46MB from progress ticks, repeated thinking blocks, stale file reads, duplicate document injections, and metadata bloat. When sessions get too big, Claude's auto-compaction kicks in and summarizes away critical context. For users running **Agent Teams**, this is catastrophic: the lead agent's context is compacted, team state (teammates, tasks, coordination messages) is discarded, and the entire team is orphaned with no way to recover.

Cozempic cleans your context intelligently:
- **Targeted strategies** — remove dead weight (progress ticks, stale reads, duplicate content) while preserving everything valuable: your conversation, decisions, tool results, and team coordination
- **Guard mode** — a background daemon that keeps sessions lean automatically, so auto-compaction never fires and Agent Teams survive across context resets

**Zero external dependencies.** Python 3.10+ stdlib only.

## Install

```bash
pip install cozempic
```

Or run directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ruya-AI/cozempic.git
cd cozempic
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# List all sessions with sizes
cozempic list

# Auto-detect and diagnose the current session
cozempic current --diagnose

# Dry-run the standard prescription on current session
cozempic treat current

# Apply with backup
cozempic treat current --execute

# Go aggressive on a specific session
cozempic treat <session_id> -rx aggressive --execute

# Keep context clean automatically — protect Agent Teams (run in a separate terminal)
cozempic guard --threshold 50 -rx standard
```

Session IDs accept full UUIDs, UUID prefixes, file paths, or `current` for auto-detection based on your working directory.

## How It Works

Cozempic uses **strategies** — targeted functions that identify what's bloat and what's valuable. Each strategy produces declarative actions (remove or replace) that clean dead weight while leaving your meaningful context untouched. Strategies are grouped into **prescriptions**:

| Prescription | Strategies | Risk | Typical Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gentle` | 3 | Minimal | 5-8% |
| `standard` | 7 | Low | 15-20% |
| `aggressive` | 13 | Moderate | 20-25% |

**Dry-run is the default.** Nothing is modified until you pass `--execute`. Backups are always created automatically.

## Strategies

| # | Strategy | What It Does | Expected |
|---|----------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | `progress-collapse` | Collapse consecutive progress tick messages | 40-48% |
| 2 | `file-history-dedup` | Deduplicate file-history-snapshot messages | 3-6% |
| 3 | `metadata-strip` | Strip token usage stats, stop_reason, costs | 1-3% |
| 4 | `thinking-blocks` | Remove/truncate thinking content + signatures | 2-5% |
| 5 | `tool-output-trim` | Trim large tool results (>8KB or >100 lines) | 1-8% |
| 6 | `stale-reads` | Remove file reads superseded by later edits | 0.5-2% |
| 7 | `system-reminder-dedup` | Deduplicate repeated system-reminder tags | 0.1-3% |
| 8 | `http-spam` | Collapse consecutive HTTP request runs | 0-2% |
| 9 | `error-retry-collapse` | Collapse repeated error-retry sequences | 0-5% |
| 10 | `background-poll-collapse` | Collapse repeated polling messages | 0-1% |
| 11 | `document-dedup` | Deduplicate large document blocks | 0-44% |
| 12 | `mega-block-trim` | Trim any content block over 32KB | safety net |
| 13 | `envelope-strip` | Strip constant envelope fields | 2-4% |

Run a single strategy:

```bash
cozempic strategy progress-collapse <session_id> -v
cozempic strategy thinking-blocks <session_id> --thinking-mode truncate
```

## Commands

```
cozempic list [--project NAME]          List sessions with sizes
cozempic current [-d]                   Show/diagnose current session (auto-detect)
cozempic diagnose <session>             Analyze bloat sources (read-only)
cozempic treat <session> [-rx PRESET]   Run prescription (dry-run default)
cozempic treat <session> --execute      Apply changes with backup
cozempic strategy <name> <session>      Run single strategy
cozempic reload [-rx PRESET]            Treat + auto-resume in new terminal
cozempic guard [--threshold MB]         Auto-clean context, prevent Agent Teams loss
cozempic doctor [--fix]                 Check for known Claude Code issues
cozempic formulary                      Show all strategies & prescriptions
```

Use `current` as the session argument in any command to auto-detect the active session for your working directory.

## Guard — Agent Teams Context Loss Prevention

> **The problem:** Agent Teams are lost after auto-compaction. When a session grows too large, Claude's auto-compaction summarizes the lead agent's context — discarding TeamCreate, SendMessage, TaskCreate/Update messages. The lead forgets its teammates exist. Subagents become orphaned. There is no built-in recovery. ([#23620](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/23620), [#23821](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/23821), [#24052](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/24052), [#21925](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/21925))

Guard is a background daemon that **prevents auto-compaction from ever triggering** by continuously cleaning dead weight — while preserving every conversation, decision, and team coordination message that matters.

```bash
# Protect Agent Teams — run this in a separate terminal
cozempic guard --threshold 50 -rx standard

# Without auto-reload (just prune the file, no restart)
cozempic guard --threshold 50 --no-reload

# Lower threshold, faster checks
cozempic guard --threshold 30 --interval 15
```

**How it works:**

1. Monitors the active session JSONL file size every 30 seconds
2. When the threshold is crossed, **extracts full team state** — teammates, tasks, roles, coordination messages
3. Writes a crash-safe checkpoint to `.claude/team-checkpoint.md`
4. Prunes the session with **team-protect** — TeamCreate, SendMessage, TaskCreate/Update messages are never removed
5. **Injects team state as a synthetic message pair** directly into the JSONL — when Claude resumes, it *sees* the team as conversation history (force-read, not a suggestion)
6. Triggers auto-reload (kill + resume in new terminal) so Claude picks up the pruned context

**The result:** Your context stays clean and under threshold — auto-compaction never fires. Everything valuable is preserved: your conversation history, decisions, tool results, and full Agent Teams coordination state. No more orphaned subagents, no more lost context.

## Doctor

Beyond context cleaning, Cozempic can check for known Claude Code configuration issues:

```bash
cozempic doctor        # Diagnose issues
cozempic doctor --fix  # Auto-fix where possible
```

Current checks:

| Check | What It Detects |
|-------|----------------|
| `trust-dialog-hang` | `hasTrustDialogAccepted=true` in `~/.claude.json` causing resume hangs on Windows |
| `oversized-sessions` | Session files >50MB likely to hang on resume |
| `stale-backups` | Old `.bak` files from previous treatments wasting disk |
| `disk-usage` | Total session storage exceeding healthy thresholds |

The `--fix` flag auto-applies fixes where safe (e.g., resetting the trust dialog flag, cleaning stale backups). Backups are created before any config modification.

## Claude Code Integration

### Slash Command

Cozempic ships with a `/cozempic` slash command for Claude Code. Install it by copying the command file to your user-level commands directory:

```bash
cp .claude/commands/cozempic.md ~/.claude/commands/cozempic.md
```

Then from any Claude Code session, type `/cozempic` to diagnose and treat the current session interactively. You can also pass a prescription directly: `/cozempic aggressive`.

After treatment, exit and resume the session to load the pruned context:

```bash
claude --resume
```

### SessionStart Hook (Optional)

To persist the session ID as an environment variable for use in scripts and other hooks:

```bash
cp .claude/hooks/persist-session-id.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/persist-session-id.sh
```

Add to your `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "~/.claude/hooks/persist-session-id.sh"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

This makes `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` available in all Bash commands during the session.

## Safety

- **Always dry-run by default** — `--execute` flag required to modify files
- **Timestamped backups** — automatic `.bak` files before any modification
- **Never touches uuid/parentUuid** — conversation DAG stays intact
- **Never removes summary/queue-operation messages** — structurally important
- **Team messages are protected** — guard mode never prunes TeamCreate, SendMessage, TaskCreate/Update
- **Strategies compose sequentially** — each runs on the output of the previous, so savings are accurate and don't overlap
